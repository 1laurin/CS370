# Treasure Hunt Game

## Project Overview

In this project, I implemented an intelligent agent (the pirate) using deep Q-learning to solve a pathfinding problem in a treasure hunt game. The goal was to find the optimal path for the pirate to navigate through a maze and reach the treasure while maximizing the reward.

### Work Done

The starter code provided by the course included two Python classes: `TreasureMaze.py` and `GameExperience.py`. The `TreasureMaze` class represented the environment, including the maze object defined as a matrix. The `GameExperience` class stored the episodes – the states that come in between the initial state and the terminal state – for the agent to learn from experience.

I was responsible for completing the Q-Training Algorithm code block, which involved implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm. Specifically, I implemented the `qtrain` function, where the agent learns the optimal policy for navigating the maze through trial-and-error experiences and updates a neural network model to approximate the Q-value function.

### Connection to Computer Science

Computer scientists play a crucial role in solving complex problems across various domains by designing and developing algorithms, software, and systems. Their work has a significant impact on technological advancements and shapes the way we interact with and leverage technology in our daily lives.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

Computer scientists research, design, and develop computational solutions to real-world problems. They analyze complex systems, identify patterns, and create algorithms and models to solve these problems efficiently and effectively. Their work spans areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, robotics, cybersecurity, and data science, among others. 
**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

As a computer scientist, I approach problems systematically and analytically:

1. **Problem Understanding**: Clearly define the problem statement, constraints, and desired outcomes.
2. **Research and Analysis**: Investigate existing solutions, algorithms, and techniques related to the problem domain.
3. **Design and Implementation**: Develop models, algorithms, and software solutions based on the analysis.
4. **Testing and Evaluation**: Test and evaluate the proposed solution, iterating and refining as necessary.
5. **Communication and Documentation**: Communicate the solution, its implementation, and its implications to relevant stakeholders.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities towards end users and the organizations I work for:

1. **Privacy and Security**: Ensure that the solutions I develop prioritize user privacy and data security, adhering to relevant laws and regulations.
2. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: Design solutions that are accessible to diverse user groups, promoting inclusivity and addressing potential biases.
3. **Transparency and Accountability**: Maintain transparency about the capabilities, limitations, and potential impacts of the solutions I create, and take accountability for any unintended consequences.
4. **Professional Integrity**: Uphold ethical principles, avoid conflicts of interest, and prioritize the well-being of end users and society over personal or organizational gains.
5. **Continuous Learning and Adaptation**: Stay up-to-date with technological advancements and societal impacts to ensure responsible and sustainable development.
